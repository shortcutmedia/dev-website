<h2 style="text-align:left;"><a name="print">Print Communication</a></h2>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><a name="how_print">How it works</a></h3>
<p style="text-align:left;padding-bottom:10px;">You should create Shortcuts for all your offline advertising. To each Shortcut you create a QR code is attached automatically. Another alternative is that you can attach an image to the Shortcut in the Shortcut Manager.</p>
<p>These QR codes or images can be used in your offline advertising. When one of your customers scans the QR code or the image the Shortcut you created is activated. The Shortcut detects if the user has your app installed or not and sends only the users that don’t have your app installed yet to the app store. The rest of the users are directed to your in-app content.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:left;"><a name="benefits_print">The benefits you get</a></h3>
<p style="text-align:left;padding-bottom:0px;">On flyers you hand out, on billboards or in newspaper ads you usually have a limited amount of space so you want to widen this space by telling your customers that there’s more information online. Instead of having three different calls to action ( “find more information on www.mycompany.com/summersale”, a button for “app available in App Store” and a separate button for “app available in Google Play store”. Shortcut makes it possible for you to have just one clear call to action.</p>
<p>Offline advertising also often require a big investment so you really want to track how well the ads worked so that you don’t mistakenly make the same investment again. Shortcut tracks every scan for the QR code or the image so you will be able to follow these user’s user journey and get insights into e.g their location or how many of them actually downloaded the app.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:left;"><a name="how_beacon">How it works</a></h3>
<p style="text-align:left;padding-bottom:10px;">By combining iBeacons with your Shortcuts you can target your communication to customers that have your app installed and that are in or near your business location. You just need to configure your iBeacon with the UUID and the values and messages that you fill in in the Shortcut Manager and you can start communicating to your in-store and nearre and near-store app users.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:left;"><a name="benefits_beacon">The benefits you get</a></h3>
<p style="text-align:left;padding-bottom:0px;">The benefits you can get from using Shortcuts in-store communication are countless. The main benefit is that you can engage your existing users to use your app in a way that is innovative and full of pleasant surprises that are convenient for your users.</p>
<p>You can communicate with the customers that are already in your store or nearby. With Shortcut you can make sure that your customers are aware of ongoing promotions.</p>
<p>If you have a retail app you might have collected some personal information about your customer. Let’s say you have clothes store and in your app your customer has created their wishlist. WIth iBeacons you have your chance to remind your customer of that wish list and at the same time let them know if you have any related promotions.</p>
<p>Maybe you have a restaurant or café chain and you want to surprise the customers. You could for example send a message to all your customers that have been sitting at your café for more than an hour and tell them that their next coffee is 50% off.</p>
<p>There are unlimited possibilities that for example a resort app or a shopping mall app could use Shortcut’s in-store communication for. Hotel’s upsell and ask their guests if they would like to have room service or reserve a table at the hotel restaurant. A shopping mall app can help their stores advertise their promotions through the app.</p>
<p>If a customer is close to your store you can remind them of your existence. Make sure they don’t just pass by but that your customer’s pop in for a visit.</p>
<p>In a museum or an art gallery you could attach iBeacons to the artwork and send the app users for example audio recordings with more information about the artist. Or a city could have iBeacons at important monuments and buildings to tell tourists that are passing by the story behind them.</p>
